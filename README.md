# calculator
A web-based calculator application

What I want to happen
1. User inputs a number
2. Number gets stored by system
3. Continue storing digits up until 9 digits or an operator is pressed
4. When user presses an operator, store which operator they inputted
5. Allow users to input digits until 9 digits or an operator is pressed
6. Compute the expression, round the value such that there are less than 9 digits, store the value as the first value of an operand, and return to (5)

Program Decomposition
1. Create a front-end shell
2. Create event listeners for each button such that, on click, they return their value
3. Create function to parse input correctly
4. Create function to complete operation
5. Create function to update display
6. Create delete function
7. Create clear function
8. Prevent division by 0
9. Support decimal functionality
10. Add keyboard functionality?
